# ListSorting
Some research into sorting of lists in Python.
This code imports the function 'nsmallest'.
This function allows the program to limit the array to n number of smallest absolute values from a specific number.

Note for efficiency = The algorithm for nsmallest makes a single pass over the data, keeping no more than the n best values in memory at any time (that means that it works with any input iterator, is cache-efficient, and space-efficient).
Similar to function - min()
